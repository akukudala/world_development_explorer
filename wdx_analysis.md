# Analyzing the percentages of female population (age 15-19) education stats over the years 2010 to 2015 
## Indicators to consider
* No Education
* Completed Primary Education
* Completed Secondary Education

The primary motive of this project is to focus on Female Primary and Secondary education in East Asia & Pacific region. 
Many governments publish statistics showing how well their education systems are working and improving,
with data on enrollment and completion. 
Monitoring progress toward national and global education targets helps allocate resources more efficiently and make quality learning opportunities accessible to all.
Better-quality education leads to an empowered citizenry and a more productive labor force. We will also analyze the mentioned region with the other regions in the world as per data derived from 
World Development Explorer. The reason why most of the females in the world are left uneducationed is due to their financial background. Let us consider the Financial states of the region to compare 
the correlation between the education and the income.

- **Data Source:** World Development Explorer ([worlddev.xyz](https://))
